It would have been helpful for you to review the Enumeration Types to aid in giving more clarity to your class diagram. This would’ve been useful to declare the different artifacts the Space class could hold. Even though you did specify some attributes that expressed this I found it difficult to pin-point and would assume the same issue would occur once you begin the actual implementation.

Another area for improvement for the class diagram was maybe going over the problem statement more carefully. There were various phrases that should’ve turn into classes or more closely should have resembled in the naming.

The sequence diagram presented was probably the strongest piece in your assignment 2 submission. The utilization of loops with guards was something I did not consider for my own diagram. Definitely wish I would have reviewed Larman’s Chapter 10 more closely.

Comment text: You have good coupling among classes (interdependencies) and have used types adequately as was recommended in the project specification! I do see also were you separated DroneAction into its own class along with coordinates and orientation. I think there is too much cohesion here and these should be split into separate enumerable types to allow better overall composability. Also, I don’t see any enumerable types listed on your diagram and the instructions required specific enum terms to be included. These were for the state of the surrounding squares : {stars, empty, sun, barrier, drone}. I see your content attribute in the Space class, but you really should restrict values like this because what if other developers work on the same thing and they change the content to words they like or they change the casing?

Comment text: Out of all of the class diagrams I’ve seen, you correctly labeled the property string for the ordered list so good job on that. I don’t see the multiplicity factor for class space between space and coordinates. You added 1 to 1 associations on others so not adding it here does not make it clear as to what your intentions were. See Larman’s figure 16.5. Your aggregation diamond is very hard to see and almost looks like an arrow between region and space. I don’t see a method on Drone to print the drone action out, as was detailed in the instruction requirements.

Comment text: Your sequence diagram is blurry for some reason and the text is hard to read. It is still legible though. You’re missing the correct formatting or the lifeline box naming for class instantiation. I see you opted for the vertical solid lines, which is correct (in addition to the dashed lines) as I recall from Larman/Lectures. It appears you’ve looped through the drones correctly. I think you can potentially get away from using the loops for the markAsExplored() method with some type of event emitter solution. Overall, I think you did a good job on the sequence diagram. I didn’t see the print report/results but if you add that and clean it up a bit you’ll be set!

Course Topic: Sequence diagram issues
Content Reference: Larman book. Chapter 15
Comment Text: 
There are some issues with Sequence diagram design/-
-	Object lifeline is missing to show how long the object was active. Please refer figure 15.10 in book. It is important because through diagram developer will know which object was active for short amount of time verses long period of time.
-	Nested activation bar is missing for object to call itself. Please refer figure 15.9 in book. For example since Drone class has method scan(), pass(), thrust(). We could show that in sequence diagram by calling drone object itself using nested activation bar.
-	The return results are not shown using dotted line. Please refer figure 15.8. Example in this case when drone receives information through Simulation, the results should be dotted showing it returned.

Course Topic: Class Diagram issue
Content Reference: Larman Book Chapter 16
Comment Text: 
In Class diagram, the Cardinality of Simulation to Drone is one or many. However, Simulation class can have zero or many drone. Because one of the requirement is once Simulation does not have any more drone meaning drone number equals to zero, the system will be halt. Another issue is class diagram is Space class has setter method. In Larman book, it states that setter and getter method creates higher noise-to-value ratio. So, it is not good practice to put setter method in Space class. Another issue is in Simulation class it does not have any attributes to record the initial Sun numbers and Sun’s coordinates. There is no enum or some form of variable to store if explored space is start versus sun versus drone versus empty.

Course Topic: Missing functionality
Content Reference: Requirement of Assignment 2
Comment Text: 
The system should know when to halt the system. System must halt in 3 cases if there is zero number of drones, if there is maximum number of turns or if all the region is explored. Sequence diagram nor class diagram represent any methods that will halt the system. There is no functionality to delete drone in Simulation class. Once the drone is crash with another drone or with Sun, there is no list of drone object in Simulation to delete that particular drone. In class diagram there is attribute droneLeft with integer data type however, it is just a number of drone left not actual drone details. Simulation should know details about drone object which are alive and should have method to destroy it.
